description: Agent-only playbook for answering an X mention in X mode. Use on an "x-mention <request_id>" check: wake - read the stashed question, compose a short public-safe reply from live fleet state in firstmate's own voice, post it with bin/fm-x-reply.sh, and clear the inbox file. Loaded only when X mode is enabled.

# fmx-respond

X mode lets a firstmate instance answer public mentions of the shared `@myfirstmate` bot on X.
A mention arrives through the watcher as a `check:` wake whose payload is `x-mention <request_id>`.
The full question is stashed locally; this skill turns it into one public reply.

This runs only when X mode is on (the user dropped `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` into `.env`; see AGENTS.md "X mode").
If you ever see an `x-mention` wake without X mode configured, do nothing.

## The reply is public. Treat it as such.

The answer is posted publicly on X under a **shared** bot account.
This is a strict version of the section 9 "talk in outcomes" rule, with a wider blast radius - assume anyone can read it.

Never include, in any form:

- Task ids, branch names, worktree paths, PR/issue numbers, or repo-internal identifiers.
- Tooling/internal vocabulary: crewmate, scout, ship, secondmate, harness names, watcher, heartbeat, brief, teardown, no-mistakes, yolo, delivery modes.
- Captain-private material: the captain's name, product strategy, unreleased plans, revenue, internal URLs, file contents, or anything the captain has not made public.
- Secrets of any kind: tokens, keys, credentials, the pairing token, hostnames.

Speak only in **outcomes**: what is being built, fixed, looked into, or shipped, described the way you would to an outsider.
When in doubt, say less. A vague-but-safe reply always beats a specific leak.

## Voice

Reply in firstmate's own voice - the crisp, lightly nautical first-mate persona - but **public-facing**:

- Do not address the asker as "captain"; they are not your captain. You may refer to *the* captain in the third person ("the captain's got me on a few things").
- Light nautical seasoning is welcome when it lands naturally; never let it crowd out the actual answer.
- Keep it tweet-length and self-contained. The relay also truncates, but write short on purpose - one or two sentences.

## Procedure

This is a drain over the inbox, not a single reply. The watcher coalesces same-key `check:` wakes, so one `x-mention` wake can stand in for several pending mentions. Treat `state/x-inbox/` as the source of truth and answer **every** file you find there, not just the `request_id` named in the wake.

1. **Gather live fleet state once.** Compose answers from what this instance genuinely knows right now:
   - `data/backlog.md` "## In flight" - the work currently moving.
   - `state/*.status` - the latest line of each in-flight job, for fresh phase detail.
   - `data/projects.md` - the active projects, for naming what you work on in plain terms.
   Translate every internal item into an outcome. Example: a backlog line `fix-login-k3 - repair OAuth redirect (repo: yourapp)` becomes "patching a sign-in redirect bug on one of the apps" - no id, no repo name unless it is already public.
2. **Drain every pending mention.** For each `state/x-inbox/*.json` file:
   a. Read the object: you need `request_id` and `text`. Ignore `tweet_id` entirely - you never name a tweet; the relay binds the reply for you.
   b. **Compose** one short, public-safe reply that actually answers `.text`. If nothing is in flight, say so honestly and in-voice (e.g. "Calm seas just now - nothing underway, standing by for the captain's next orders.").
   c. **Post it without ever inlining the reply into a shell command.** Public mention text can influence your prose, so a double-quoted shell argument is unsafe (command substitution, variable expansion, quote breakage). Write the composed reply to a temporary file with your own file-writing tool - never via shell interpolation - then pass it by path:

      ```sh
      bin/fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> --text-file <path-to-reply-file>
      ```

      (`bin/fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> -`, reading the reply on stdin, is equally fine.) It echoes the `request_id` and exits 0 on success; non-zero on a failed post.
   d. **On success, remove that inbox file:** `rm -f state/x-inbox/<request_id>.json` (and your temporary reply file). This is the local idempotency guard - a cleared file is never answered twice.
   e. **On failure** (non-zero exit), leave that inbox file in place, move on to the next, and do not retry blindly. If a reply fails twice, surface it to the captain as a blocker with the relay's HTTP status; the relay posts its own offline reply if no answer lands in time, so a single miss is not a crisis.

## Notes

- One mention = one reply, but a single wake may cover several pending mentions - drain them all.
- Never inline mention-influenced reply text into a shell command; always go through `--text-file` or stdin.
- The reply length authority is the relay (it trims), but a tight reply is on you.
- Never edit `bin/fm-x-poll.sh`, `bin/fm-x-reply.sh`, or the watcher to "answer faster"; the cadence is handled in bootstrap.
